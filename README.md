**BinarySelector** `[Sets][Binary]`\
Given n items, returns the binary representation for each integer from 0 to 2^n. Useful for combinatronics.

**CurveSlope** `[Curve][Analysis]`\
Returns the slope of a given curve and an integer representation of its general proportion.

**LineSDLBS** `[Curve][Primitive]`\
Same thing as "Line SDL" but also extends the curve in the opposite direction.

**NumbersToDomain** `[Maths][Domain]`\
Given a list of numbers, returns their range as a Grasshopper domain.

**RectangleCorners** `[Curve][Analysis]`\
Identifies relative positions of rectangle corners. (i.e. "top left" and "bottom right")

**RenameGeometry** `[Params][Util]`\
Suite of tools to manage the Attributes.Name property in grasshopper. Grasshopper only operates on stripped down geometry, so names can't be "actually" assigned, but this helps attempt to keep everything in line.

---

**OffsetClosed** `[Curve][Util]`\
Depreciated - Use native grasshopper component OffCrv\
Returns the region created by a curve, its offset, and their connected endpoints.
